From my childhood, I don't use to sip coffee much until I started hitting [[Body Building and Fitness|gym]].  Somewhere I heard that coffee is a good pre workout to have deep focus while working out. 

Initially I started with â‚¹2 coffee sachets, I used to just gulp it in a single go, then make faces for the bitter aftertaste, because why not.

But of course that would not last long, so then I started with mixing it with milk or milk powder, some sugar and hot water, this was going good.

After some days I realised there are many variants of coffee, according to how much ratio of milk, coffee and water we take. Like expresso, cappuccino, latte etc.

I started trying each types, but expresso was too much man!. Then I was having this curiosity that how can people taste and enjoy black coffee(which is almost 0 kcals), I had seen some people in cafes trying and enjoying the taste of it. I then started putting less sugar gradually, and surprisingly I was liking it, then after a point I stopped putting sugar.

I then started exploring many other brands of instant coffees, trying to get my hands on the best one. 

todo: add chicory and hyperlinks
- ***Nescafe Coffee***, with 0 % chicory, tastes the best, bitter and rich, expensive.
- ***Sunrise Coffee***, with 30% chicory tastes decent, less bitter and intense.
- ***Continental Coffee***, mildly bitter, won't go hard on your pocket.
- ***Columbian Coffee***, bitter, tastes decent but different from other coffees.

At this point I was on elite level, taking coffee 2-3 times day!. First around 6:30am in the morning before hitting gym, then around 11am after I reach my office to start brainstorming on my [[Web Development|work]], lastly between 3-4pm because usually I feel too much sleepy after my lunch, can't work without it.

I took this to further levels when I found out that just like tea leaves, people also sell roasted ground coffee which is different from instant coffee. Instant coffee has no residue, it mixes entirely with the base, but unlike that roasted ground coffee has some residue, so you need some apparatus to filter it the residue. 

I came across a brand ***Blue Tokai***, which sells roasted ground coffee, I bought Vienna Roast (a flavour they sell).
